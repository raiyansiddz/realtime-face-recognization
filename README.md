# Face Recognition API

Welcome to the **Face Recognition API** project! This API allows you to register users and perform real-time face recognition using your webcam. Built with **FastAPI** and leveraging the power of the `face_recognition` library, this application provides an easy-to-use interface for detecting and identifying faces.

## üöÄ Features

- **Register Users**: Upload user images with names to the system and register them for future recognition.
- **Real-Time Face Recognition**: Use a webcam to stream live recognition and detect registered users.
- **Interactive Web UI**: Responsive interface with beautiful design and minimalistic UI.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Example code and documentation in various programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Node.js, and more.
- **Easy Integration**: Comprehensive, easy-to-follow instructions for integrating the API with your own applications.

üîß Installation & Setup
1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/RaiyanSiddique/Face-Recognition-API.git
cd Face-Recognition-API
2. Install Dependencies
Next, install the dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Application
Start the FastAPI server with:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
4. Open the Web UI
Once the server is running, open your browser and visit the following URL:

Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:8000
‚ö° API Endpoints
1. /register/ (POST)
Register a new user by uploading their name and photo.

Request Parameters:
name: The name of the user (string).
photo: The image of the user (file upload).
Example (Python):
python
Copy code
import requests

url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/register/"
files = {"photo": open("path_to_image.jpg", "rb")}
data = {"name": "John"}

response = requests.post(url, data=data, files=files)
print(response.json())
Success Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "message": "User John registered successfully!"
}
2. /recognize/ (GET)
This endpoint streams live video from your webcam and performs face recognition in real time.

How to Use:
Open your browser and visit the URL below to view live face recognition in action.
arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:8000/recognize/
Notes:
This endpoint requires a webcam to be connected and working.
The recognition will automatically display names of recognized users, if their faces were previously registered.
